> I chose to use the built in dataset iris because I like flowers. 

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Create scatter plot
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +  # Adjust point size & transparency
  labs(title = "Petal Length vs. Petal Width by Species",
       x = "Petal Length (cm)",
       y = "Petal Width (cm)",
       color = "Species") +
  theme_minimal()  # Apply a clean theme

> Iris setosa is distinctly separate from the other two species, making it easier to classify.

> Iris versicolor and Iris virginica have some overlap but can still be differentiated.
