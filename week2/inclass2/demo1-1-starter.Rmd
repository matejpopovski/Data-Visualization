The data below measures properties of various Antarctic penguins.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
penguins <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv")
```
Create a single plot that makes it easy to answer both of these questions, (i)
How is bill length related to bill depth within and across species? (ii) On
which islands are which species found?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Example data
data <- data.frame(
  x = 1:10,
  y = rnorm(10),
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 5))
)
# Scatterplot with custom color palette
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("A" = "red", "B" = "blue"))

```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "red", "Chinstrap" = "blue", "Gentoo" = "green"))
```


```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = <correct_column>, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_area()

```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```
