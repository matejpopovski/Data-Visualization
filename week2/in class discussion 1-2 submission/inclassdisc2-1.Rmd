```{r}
# Setting up the R environment and loading necessary libraries
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE) # Configures knitr options for output
library(tidyverse) # Imports tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization
theme_set(theme_bw()) # Sets a consistent theme for plots

# Displaying an example tidy dataset
table1 # This dataset follows tidy data principles, making visualization straightforward

# Creating a visualization of the tidy dataset
ggplot(table1, aes(x = year, y = cases, col = country)) + # Maps year to x-axis, cases to y-axis, and country to color
  geom_point() + # Adds points to the plot
  geom_line()   # Connects the points with lines

# Example of non-tidy data - Variables stored as column names
table4a # Cases stored incorrectly as separate columns
table4b # Population stored incorrectly as separate columns

# Example of non-tidy data - The same observation appearing in multiple rows
table2 # Each country-year combination appears multiple times, making analysis difficult

# Example of non-tidy data - A single column storing multiple variables
table3 # The 'rate' column combines population and case count, losing individual values

# Attempting to visualize non-tidy data
ggplot(table3, aes(x = year, y = rate)) + # Tries to plot a combined variable
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = country)) # Groups data by country for better visualization

# ??? How does ggplot handle mixed data types in the 'rate' column?
# ??? What are the best approaches to separate 'rate' into distinct variables?
